        <h1>Prakriti Lamsal Case at KIIT: A Heartbreaking Story</h1>
        <p class="blog-date">February 20, 2025</p>
        <img src="/Prakriti-lamsal.jpg" alt="Prakriti Lamsal" class="blog-image">
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>The story of Prakriti Lamsal is one that should not be forgotten. It is a story that begins with hope, dreams, and the pursuit of a bright future but ends in tragedy. A student from Nepal, Prakriti came to India with aspirations of academic excellence and personal growth at the prestigious KIIT University. But what followed was a tale of emotional suffering, neglect, and the painful reality of a system that failed to protect her.</p>

            <h2>The Journey Begins: A Dream to Study Abroad</h2>
            <p>Prakriti’s decision to study abroad was a bold one, especially for a young woman from Nepal, in a foreign land away from her family. Like many others, she came to India with an open heart, excited about the opportunities that awaited her. She enrolled at KIIT, one of India’s reputed private universities, and settled into a new life that was supposed to be filled with academic achievements, friendships, and memorable experiences.</p>
            <p>But soon, the promise of this new life began to fade. Despite her academic potential, Prakriti faced challenges that were invisible to most—challenges that no one could have prepared her for. The distance from home was a heavy burden. The cultural shock of moving to a foreign country left her feeling alienated. But it wasn’t just the isolation that broke her spirit; it was the growing feeling of being unheard, unseen, and unsupported.</p>

            <h2>The Weight of Emotional Struggles</h2>
            <p>As weeks turned into months, Prakriti began to struggle emotionally. Far away from her loved ones, she often found herself alone in a new world that didn’t seem to have a place for her. But what compounded her sorrow was the lack of understanding and support from her immediate environment. She confided in friends, professors, and even university staff about the difficulties she was facing. Yet, all she received in return was silence—or worse, indifference.</p>
            <p>Her friends, who noticed her change in demeanor, tried to reach out, but the deepening anxiety and despair Prakriti felt were not easily seen by the university authorities. She wasn’t alone in her struggles, yet she felt as if she was. There were moments when she would try to seek help, but it seemed as though no one cared to truly listen.</p>

            <h2>Harassment and Unfair Treatment</h2>

            <p>While Prakriti was battling with these invisible demons, something even darker loomed on the horizon: the cruelty of harassment. It wasn’t just the academic pressure, the isolation, or the cultural shock—she was subjected to bullying and discrimination. Allegedly, some students at KIIT made her feel unwelcome, often passing demeaning comments and mocking her for being from Nepal. These acts were not just occasional but consistent enough to cause emotional pain.</p>
            <p>What’s even more heartbreaking is the fact that when Prakriti turned to her professors for help, she was met with harshness rather than compassion. The professors who should have acted as mentors, guiding her through both academic and personal difficulties, instead contributed to her isolation. The lack of empathy and the insensitivity of certain faculty members made her feel even more alone and misunderstood. The very people who were supposed to provide a safe space for students failed her when she needed them the most.</p>

            <h2>The Inadequate Response from KIIT</h2>

            <p>Prakriti’s suffering didn’t stop there. When the unthinkable happened, and her life was tragically cut short, KIIT University’s response to the incident was nothing short of shocking. Rather than acknowledging the severity of the situation and taking swift action to address the underlying issues, the university instead opted for silence, trying to cover up the situation. Sources allege that the university made efforts to minimize the attention the case was receiving and, in some instances, attempted to suppress the voices of students who spoke out against the treatment Prakriti received.</p>
            <p>In the aftermath of Prakriti’s death, some students reported that their phones were confiscated, and they were instructed to stay quiet about the events that had unfolded. This move raised suspicions about KIIT’s desire to keep the entire incident under wraps, possibly fearing that the incident would damage the university’s reputation.</p>

            <h2>The Impact on Nepali Students</h2>

            </video>
            <p>The impact of Prakriti’s tragic death was felt deeply, especially within the Nepali student community at KIIT. Following the incident, many Nepali students felt marginalized and targeted by the university’s administration. There were reports that Nepali students were told to leave the campus in a manner that was not only discriminatory but also heart-wrenching. It was as if they were being blamed for the incident rather than offered the support they needed in the wake of such a tragedy.</p>
            <p>At a time when solidarity should have been extended, the Nepali students were instead pushed further into the margins. This act of isolation, compounded by the perceived cover-up of Prakriti’s situation, only served to deepen the sense of injustice and loss that many students were feeling.</p>

            <h2>A Call for Justice</h2>
            <video controls disablepictureinpicture controlsList="nodownload">
                <source src="protest.mp4" type="video/mp4">

            </video>
            <p>The public response to Prakriti's death was swift and powerful. Students and activists took to social media, sharing their stories and demanding justice for Prakriti. The hashtag #JusticeForPrakriti became a rallying cry, not only for the truth to be revealed but also for systemic change. The incident sparked a broader conversation about how universities treat international students, the quality of mental health support provided, and the importance of creating an inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their background.</p>

            <h2>What Needs to Change?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Mental Health Support:</strong> Universities need to offer comprehensive mental health resources, ensuring that students are never left to face their struggles in silence. Counseling services should be readily available, and staff should be trained to recognize signs of distress in students.</li>
                <li><strong>Stronger Anti-Discrimination Policies:</strong> No student should ever feel alienated because of their background, ethnicity, or nationality. Universities must establish strict anti-discrimination policies and ensure that students from all walks of life are treated with respect and dignity.</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability for Faculty and Staff:</strong> Teachers and university staff must be held accountable for their behavior towards students. If any professor or staff member is found to be discriminatory, unprofessional, or neglectful of students' well-being, they should face appropriate consequences. This will ensure that the university creates a safe space for all students, especially those from vulnerable backgrounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Transparency:</strong> Universities must be transparent about incidents that involve student welfare. Covering up incidents like Prakriti's tragic death only deepens the sense of injustice and leaves students feeling betrayed by the institution they trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect for International Students:</strong> International students, like Prakriti, should be treated with respect and given the necessary support to adapt to their new environments. Their cultural differences should be acknowledged, and they should not be made to feel like outsiders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The story of Prakriti Lamsal is one that echoes the need for systemic change in how universities handle the emotional and mental well-being of their students. Her tragic end highlights the shortcomings of an education system that often prioritizes academic excellence over emotional and psychological health. It also emphasizes the importance of creating an inclusive environment where students from all backgrounds feel safe, heard, and valued.</p>
            <p>Prakriti’s legacy should not be one of despair but one of change—a catalyst for improving student support systems and ensuring that no student ever feels isolated or neglected in their journey to higher education. Justice for Prakriti Lamsal is not just about seeking accountability for her death but about ensuring that future students never have to face the same fate.</p>
